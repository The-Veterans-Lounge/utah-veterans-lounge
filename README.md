# The Veterans Lounge

**A place for veterans to belong.**

The Veterans Lounge is a Utah County nonprofit organization dedicated to providing a welcoming community space where military veterans can connect, support one another, and access resources for their post-service journey.

## Our Mission

We believe every veteran deserves a place to belong. Through weekly gatherings, community events, and peer support, we create an environment where veterans can build lasting friendships and find the camaraderie that defined their military service.

## What We Do

### Weekly Poker Nights
Every Thursday evening, veterans gather for our signature poker nights - a relaxed setting where stories are shared, friendships are forged, and the isolation many veterans face is replaced with genuine community connection.

### Community Events & Fundraisers
We host regular events that bring veterans and their families together while supporting local veteran causes and building awareness of veteran needs in Utah County.

### Resource Navigation
We're developing comprehensive resources to help Utah veterans access services, benefits, and opportunities available to them throughout their civilian transition and beyond.
